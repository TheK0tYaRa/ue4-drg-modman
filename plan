Write a minimal gui that is optimal for simple ui. Features supported in backend must include: bool switch that slides to the side, overlay scrollbar that dissapears if not scrolling, vertical list of horizontal rows that consist of cells, with the whole row being selectable and the possibility of selecting many, input field that has on change trigger, ui element naming for later search, function on click assignment, dark theme, label with colored background, element grouping into rollout select list .

Let's make it pull from cache. From now on, send partial changes as changes with 2 lines of context, no more. The cache will be a sqlite database that contains: modID, modName, modLink (can be url that is either to a local file or http* url), folder that contains downloads of that mod (it will contain folders named as mod versions), a selected version string, a state (enabled or not bool). There must be one table per profile and one row per mod. And do add the rollout selection for profile with a button at the bottom, that button must serve as profile creation button. Initially only Default profile and the new profile are in said rollout selection.
